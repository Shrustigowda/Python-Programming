INDEXING IN PYTHON..
**Every word in this string has a unique index i,e position of the word in the particular value.
**In the string the number will begin from zero.

EXAMPLES:-
1]  x="Water"
   #If we want 't' somewhere then,
    x[2]
    
  OUTPUT:
   't'
   
2] x="Water"   
   x[3]
   
  OUTPUT:
    'e'  
    
 3] x="Hello world"
    x=[6]
    
  OUTPUT:
    'w'
    
    ****So this is known as INDEX IN PYTHON *****
