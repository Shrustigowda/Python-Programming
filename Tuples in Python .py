#Unique charecteristics are:-
* Tuples are in franics ->(),like  x=().
* Tuples elements cannot be changed or cannot be manupilated.
Examples:-

1] x=("red","blue","green","yellow","black",12,4.3)
   x.append(34)
   
#It will be an error bcoz tuples elements cannot be changed.
#If we need to know the methods in tuples then use 
   dir(tuples)
#The list of methods in the tuples will be displayed.
*Once the tuple is created it will be same towards the program.
*Tuples are used less due to their less flexibility.
*But tuples are used in some typical cases.
*But adding and removing from tuples is not possible.
